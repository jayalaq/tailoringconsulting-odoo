# Holiday Field Payroll

## Summary

This module has been designed with the purpose of improving EPS management, in the module locating two fields, EPS credit and EPS management (management_eps).

- It also creates in the Employee module in the health area private information tab (hr.employee) at the bottom, a field called EPS (exists_eps) and EPS Policy (management_eps).
- Where the EPS policy field (management_eps) will be hidden as long as the boolean is not activated in the EPS field (exists_eps) and in the policy that the employee is registered from the employee file (hr.employee) it must also be reflected from the module location where the policies were created (management_eps).
